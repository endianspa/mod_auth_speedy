===========================================================================

mod_proxy_speedy is proxy_module_express protecting + backend protection

This module creates dynamically configured mass reverse proxies, by mapping
the Host: header of the HTTP request to a server name and backend URL
stored in a DBM file.

This allows for easy use of a huge number of reverse proxies with no
configuration changes.

Each backend can be protected with a password.

 Dependencies
===========================================================================

mod_proxy_speedy has the following dependencies:
 * pkg-config
 * Apache (>=2.0)

You will also require development headers and tools for all of the
dependencies.

If Apache is installed in a "strange" directory, then you may have to
specify the path to apxs2 using the --with-apxs2=/full/path/to/apxs2
option to configure. If, for example, Apache is installed in /opt/apache,
with apxs2 in /opt/apache/bin, then you run

./configure --with-apxs2=/opt/apache2/bin/apxs2

Note that, depending on your distribution,  apxs2 may be named apxs.


===========================================================================
 Installing mod_proxy_speedy
===========================================================================

mod_proxy_speedy uses autoconf, and can be installed by running the
following commands:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install


===========================================================================
 Configuring mod_proxy_speedy
===========================================================================

Here we are going to assume that your web servers hostname is
'example.com', and that the directory you are going to protect is
'http://example.com/secret/'. We are also going to assume that you have
configured your web site to use SSL.

You need to edit the configuration file for your web server. Depending on
your distribution, it may be named '/etc/apache/httpd.conf' or something
different.


You need to add a LoadModule directive for mod_proxy_speedy. This will
look similar to this:

LoadModule proxy_speedy_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy_speedy.so

To find the full path to mod_proxy_speedy.so, you may run:

apxs2 -q LIBEXECDIR

This will print the path where Apache stores modules. mod_proxy_speedy.so
will be stored in that directory.

You will also need to make sure that Apache's authn_core module is also
enabled. Most likely you also want authz_user to be enabled.

After you have added the LoadModule directive, you must add configuration
for mod_proxy_speedy. The following is an example configuration:
